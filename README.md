# Fragariyo: Hunting for Protein Fragments
###### Update: May 13th, 2024

## What is Top-Down Mass Spectrometry?
In Top-Down Mass Spectrometry protein or protein complexes are fragmented intact inside a mass spectrometer. Therefore, if there are specific combination of Post-Translationla Modifications or amino acid substitutions fragmentation will be obtined for each one (unfrotunatly, in bottom the resultatn digested mix of peptides precludes the determination of an specific protein from - a.k.a proteoform). For more details, see the publications below.

Fragariyo is a collection of Python 3 scripts to enable peak matching 
and some data analysis tools for native top-down experiments. See the 
SOP for more information.
